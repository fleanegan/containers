# Ft_Containers 
This is a project of the cursus of ecole 42. The goal is to rewrite some containers of the c++ Standard Template Library (stl). This includes map, vector, stack and some related helper functions. Map uses a red-black-tree as underlying data structure. The code is written with cpp98 support. 

# Examples

```
make
```

# Tests
The code is unit tested using the test framework googletest (https://github.com/google/googletest).
```

```
